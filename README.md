# playdopewars
an experiment into using genetic algorithms for playing dopewars

repo contains a simplified implementation of the classic dopewars game
(see state.py) and necessary data structures to create a code for
deriving the structures used for genetic programming (see
structures.py). the dopewars.py the runs the code to try and derive an
algorithm that plays the game.
